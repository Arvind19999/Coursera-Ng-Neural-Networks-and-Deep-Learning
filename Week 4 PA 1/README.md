# Algorithm
- deep neural network

# Implementation
- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.
- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.

# Implementation in detail

**After this assignment you will be able to:**
  - Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
  - Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
  - Implement an easy-to-use neural network class

**Outline of the Assignment**
  - Initialize the parameters for a two-layer network and for an  LL -layer neural network.
  - Implement the forward propagation module (shown in purple in the figure below).
    - Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's forward propagation step (resulting in  Z[l]Z[l] ).
    - We give you the ACTIVATION function (relu/sigmoid).
    - Combine the previous two steps into a new [LINEAR->ACTIVATION] forward function.
    - Stack the [LINEAR->RELU] forward function L-1 time (for layers 1 through L-1) and add a [LINEAR->SIGMOID] at the end (for the final layer  LL ). This gives you a new L_model_forward function.
  - Compute the loss.
  - Implement the backward propagation module (denoted in red in the figure below).
    - Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's backward propagation step.
    - We give you the gradient of the ACTIVATE function (relu_backward/sigmoid_backward)
    - Combine the previous two steps into a new [LINEAR->ACTIVATION] backward function.
    - Stack [LINEAR->RELU] backward L-1 times and add [LINEAR->SIGMOID] backward in a new L_model_backward function
  - Finally update the parameters.
