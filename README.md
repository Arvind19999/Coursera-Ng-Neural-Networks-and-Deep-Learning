- Week 1:
  - Understand the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
  - Be able to explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning.
  - Understand what are the major categories of models (such as CNNs and RNNs), and when they should be applied.
  - Be able to recognize the basics of when deep learning will (or will not) work well.
- Week 2:
  - Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network
  - Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
  - Implement computationally efficient, highly vectorized, versions of models.
  - Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
  - Become familiar with Python and Numpy
  - Work with iPython Notebooks
  - Be able to implement vectorization across multiple training examples
